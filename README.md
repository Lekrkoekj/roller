## Download Roller
**To download the game for Android, [go to the Releases page](https://github.com/Lekrkoekj/roller/releases).**
**The game is also playable in your web browser on [Lekrkoekj Geems](https://lekrkoekj.github.io/geems/roller), and will be added to the [Lekrkoekj Launcher](https://lekrkoekj.github.io/launcher) soon.**

 
## What is Roller?
Roller is a game made using the Unity Engine and is written in C#. Some of the code is based on code written for my other game, [Lekrkoekj Dash](https://lekrkoekj.github.io/lkd).

In Roller, you have to move a rolling ball from side to side to avoid rolling into obstacles or falling off the map.

**Roller is still in development and is not done yet. It currently features 1 world with 4 levels, but will include a lot more levels, a shop system, more abilities, quests, and more.**
